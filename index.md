Hi!

I am Mateusz, and I work as a Data Scientist and Python Software developer at [NASK](https://en.nask.pl/){:target="_blank"}. 
My main research interests focus on using deep learning in medical informatics, magnetic resonance imaging, and image processing. Besides that, I help to build stuff in Python.
